# The public SAMPLE dataset

The SAMPLE dataset (Synthetic and Measured Paired Labeled Experiment) dataset consists of measured SAR imagery from the MSTAR data collect and is paired with simulated synthetic SAR imagery. The public version of this dataset is data with azimuth angles between 10 and 80 degrees. 

For a description of the dataset, please read the paper in this repository, which has the filename "sample_public.pdf". 

verify.py is used internally to verify the composition of the dataset.

Distribution A: Approved for public release. Distribution unlimited. 

PA Approval for paper is #88ABW-2019-1483.

PA Approval for SAMPLE dataset is #88ABW-2019-1300
